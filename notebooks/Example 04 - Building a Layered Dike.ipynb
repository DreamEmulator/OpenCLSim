    "As can be seen in the code fragment above, the Activity class takes the Simpy environment and a name as its constructor arguments. This is because it is defined as a mixin of the SimpyObject and Identifiable core classes. To construct an activity we also needed to define the origin, destination, loader, mover and unloader. Finally, we can optionally define conditions that need to be satisfied for the transportation of materials to take place. These are separated in __start_condition__, __stop_condition__ and __condition__ arguments:\n",
    "* __start_condition__: The activity will start as soon as this condition is satisfied. If this condition is not yet satisfied at the start of the simulation the activity will be suspended untill the condition is satisfied at a later time. Since we do not want any clay to be transported to the later sites if the previous site has not yet been completed, we define this condition as a start_condition.\n",
    "* __stop_condition__: After the activity has started (the start_condition was satisfied), it will regularly check if the stop_condition has been satisfied. If so, the activity is considered complete and will terminate. A simulation will not terminate untill all of its activities have been completed. By default (with stop_condition=None), the stop_condition is set to either the origin container being empty, or the destination container being full. This is sufficient in our case, so we do not specify a stop_condition. \n",
    "* __condition__: After the activity has started (the start_condition was satisfied) and as long as the stop_condition is not satisfied, the activity will continuously check whether this condition is satisfied. If so, it will complete exactly one transportation of materials (loading the mover at the origin and unloading the mover at the destination). If not, the activity will wait untill the condition is satisfied again. Defining such a condition allows for the activity to be temporarily halted, for example due to bad weather or other working conditions, and resuming at a later time when the problem preventing work has passed. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these condition arguments take a \"Condition\" object. This object should have a \"satisfied\" method which returns a boolean indicating whether the condition is satsified or not. The digital twin package provides a LevelCondition, allowing you to quickly construct a condition which will check if an object extending HasContainer has a certain minimum and/or maximum level. It also provides an AndCondition and OrCondition which allow for combining other condition objects into a single condition. You can also provide your own \"Condition\" class, for example you could program a \"Condition\" class which depending on the time in the simulation (the .now fixture of the Simpy environment), returns whether the weather is good enough for work to take place:"
